# ESKAPEE_pathogen processed RefSeq dataset
Here the acronym ESKAPEE comprises of 7 pathogens namely Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter species, and E. Coli.
This repository contains the processed RefSeq data of ESKAPEE pathogens and non ESKAPEE categories such as Human DNA, Fungi, and non ESKAPEE bacteria.
This is part of dataset that we used to train AI models for this work by my team: "AI-based Dynamic web server for real-time classification of raw genome sequences of ESKAPEE pathogens"
We have made this work publicly available from http://115.241.23.53:8000
