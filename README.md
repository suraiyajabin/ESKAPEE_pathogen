# ESKAPEE_pathogen processed RefSeq dataset
Here the acronym ESKAPEE comprises of 7 pathogens namely Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter species, and E. Coli.
This repository contains the processed RefSeq data of ESKAPEE pathogens and non ESKAPEE categories such as Human DNA, Fungi, and non ESKAPEE bacteria.
This is part of dataset that we used to train AI models for this work by my research group: "AI-based Dynamic web server for real-time classification of raw genome sequences of ESKAPEE pathogens". We deployed the AI model linked with this work as a dynamic web server on http://115.241.23.53:8000. It is publicly available from the link: http://115.241.23.53:8000 so that researchers may upload their data (in FQ/FASTQ.gz format) to check ESKAPEE labels.
